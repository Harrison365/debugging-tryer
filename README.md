## Debugging & Errors

### Part 1 - Exercises

Take a look at the `exercises` folder. Inside, you will see several files. In each one, some Northcoders staff have written some code. But, despite trying their best - they are not perfect! Please fix them so that, when you run the file with `node <file name>.js`, all the tests pass.

P.S. Please don't make any alterations to the tests, and make sure you have also `cd` into the correct folder before running each file.

### Part 2 - Advanced Tasks

When you have completed all of these exercises, take a look in the `advanced` folder. The idea behind these challenges is the same - read the current function carefully, identifying the bugs and solving it to make the tests pass.

Note: sometimes the problem might not even be in the file where the function is written!
